    <p>You've just created a very simply Scala application!  Now lets explore the code, see it run, and makes some changes.</p>

    <h2> Explore the Code</h2>

    <p>This very simple application contains just one source file.  To navigate to that file, select "Code" on the left, then select the "app" directory, and select the <a href="#code/app/Hello.scala" class="shortcut">Hello.scala</a> file.</p>

    <p>Now you are seeing source of the "Hello" object.  You'll notice that this object extends the "App" trait which provides a simple way to create an executable application.  The body of the object simply prints "hello, world" to the console.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2> Run the App</h2>

    <p>To see the output select <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> on the left, then select "Run It!".  In the logs you should see the "hello, world" message.</p>
    <!--
    <p>Every time the source code for the application changes, the application will be recompiled and rerun.  If the application has compile errors they will be displayed in the Run console.  You can disable auto-running of the application by unchecking the "auto-run" box.</p>
    -->
</div>
<div>
    <h2> Make Changes</h2>

    <p>To make changes to the application go back to <a href="#code/app/Hello.scala" class="shortcut">Hello.scala</a> and change "hello, world" to "hello, Builder" and select "Save".</p>

    <p>Navigate back to <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> and select "Run It!".  You should now see "hello, Builder" displayed.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2> Test the App</h2>

    <p>Select <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> and then select "Run Tests" to see the test results.</p>

    <p>The application has one test that is currently passing.  The <a href="#code/test/HelloSpec.scala" class="shortcut">HelloSpec.scala</a> file contains the test code.</p>
    <p>Add a new test by adding the following after line 8:
<pre><code>  "1 + 1" should "equal 2" in {
    (1 + 1) should equal (2)
  }</code></pre>Save the file and then re-run the tests.  You should now have two tests passing.</p>
